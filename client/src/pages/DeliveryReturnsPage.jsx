          All our orders are delivered via registered airmail and thanks to the
          reputable companies we use, we guarantee to deliver your products to
          your door. In order to receive the order without any problems the
          customer should provide a valid billing and shipping address.

          Total time for delivery is based on the amount of time it takes to get
          payment authorization, order processing, and the transit time from the
          carrier. You will receive an email once the order has been shipped to
          you. From the moment that you receive the email notifying you that
          your order has been shipped, the shipping time officially begins.

        <p style={paragraphStyle}>
          We offer an express shipping option in most locations. Express
          shipping means that you will receive your medications between 7-14
          business days after order fulfilment is complete (and you have
          received email notification that your order has been shipped), whereas
          via standard shipping the delivery time is between 14-21 business days
          after order fulfilment is complete.
